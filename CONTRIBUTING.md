### Commit messages

This project uses [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) as commit convention, because it's fun and provides an easy way of identifying the purpose or intention of a commit with only looking at the emojis used. All you just have to do is to find the emoji corresponding to the purpose of your commit in [this list](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) following by a short message explaining the update. You can also add a description if it's needed. That's all ðŸ˜‰

### Adding new translation or having a suggestion

Ideally you should open a suggestion issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Les-Cop1/my-setup/issues).
