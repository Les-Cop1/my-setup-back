### Getting started

Clone the project:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Les-Cop1/my-setup-back.git
```

Add environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set up the project:

yarn setup
```

### Development

To start the development server you need to run the following commands:

You probably need to run a frontend server as well. You can find the frontend [here](https://github.com/Les-Cop1/my-setup-back).
